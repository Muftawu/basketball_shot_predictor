This is a simple python script that tracks the trajectory of a basket ball after 
being shot and predicts its landing point using mathematical modelling - Polynomial regression
to be precise. 

Polynomial regression is being used because the trajectory of the shot fits that of a
ballistic one. Helper libraries used in this project include 
	- Numpy
	- Opencv
	- Cvzone
	- Math
	
The tracking and prediction is pretty accurate with a very good confidence rate.
You can try it out by cloning the repo and running the script.
